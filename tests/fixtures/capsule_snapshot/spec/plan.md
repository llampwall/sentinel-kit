# Golden Feature Plan

## Implementation Surfaces
- Capsule author ensures `.specify/specs/golden-feature/capsule.md` stays under budget.
- README snippet documents the workflow via md-surgeon.

## Router Notes

- Keep Allowed Context restricted to README + spec docs.

## Allowed Context Seeds

- tests/fixtures/capsule_snapshot/spec/spec.md
- tests/fixtures/capsule_snapshot/spec/plan.md
- tests/fixtures/capsule_snapshot/spec/tasks.md
