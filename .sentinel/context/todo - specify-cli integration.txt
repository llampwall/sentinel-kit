src/specify_cli/__init__.py is the stock Spec‑Kit initializer—it scaffolds the project folders, copies the agent prompt bundles (.codex, .claude, etc.), and prints the standard /speckit.* next‑steps. We don’t have to change it for SentinelKit to work, but there are two high‑leverage places we could extend when you’re ready:

1. Agent Config – add a “sentinel” entry so specify init --ai sentinel can copy a .sentinel/prompts/ bundle (router + capsule templates) into the target repo the same way it does for .codex or .claude. That keeps new projects from manually pasting our prompt files.

2. Post-init hooks – just after it finishes printing the Next Steps, we could optionally run a “Sentinel add-on” hook: drop .sentinel/ scaffolding, set up the MCP scripts, or call our capsule generator. That keeps SentinelKit wiring in sync whenever someone uses the CLI instead of cloning this repo.

If we don’t need turnkey onboarding, we can leave the file untouched and keep documenting “after you specify init, run pnpm sentinel:init” or similar. But if you want SentinelKit to feel first-class, this is the right file to extend—it’s the only place Spec‑Kit touches agent templates and could copy our prompts/context scaffolding automatically.



Makes sense—let Spec-Kit keep controlling --ai for the base agent scaffolding, and add a separate --sentinel (or --with-sentinel) flag that layers our artifacts on top of whatever bundle they pick. That way users can still choose Copilot, Codex, etc., and the flag just means “after you copy that agent’s prompts, run the SentinelKit hook to drop .sentinel/**, router prompts, MCP scripts, etc.” We can wire that into specify_cli/__init__.py later—just note it in your integration doc so when we implement the hook we know exactly what the flag should do.
