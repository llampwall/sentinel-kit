# Implementation Notes

## Current Enforcement Surface
> Track which Sentinel gates are active in this repo (contracts, context lint, capsule generator, sentinel tests, MCP smokes, etc.).

- _No entries yet. Use `sentinel runbook append --section enforcement --note "..." --author ...`._

## Execution Flow
> Describe how Spec-Kit + SentinelKit commands are wired together (specify init/check, slash commands, CI ordering).

- _No entries yet. Use `sentinel runbook append --section flow --note "..." --author ...`._

## Known Gaps
> Capture open issues, deferred work, or risks that still need attention.

- _No entries yet. Use `sentinel runbook append --section gaps --note "..." --author ...`._

## CI Workflow
> Summarize the Sentinel-aware CI matrix (bootstrap, sentinel selfcheck, pytest markers, artifact uploads).

- _No entries yet. Use `sentinel runbook append --section ci --note "..." --author ...`._

## Stack Context
> Record runtime/tooling choices (Python version, uv commands, bootstrap scripts, agent bundles) and why they were selected.

- _No entries yet. Use `sentinel runbook append --section stack --note "..." --author ...`._
